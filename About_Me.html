  	<h1 class="introduction-heading">Profile Summary</h1>
  	<p class="introduction-cont">I'm currently a student entrepreneur from Nanyang Technological University and am an avid believer in chasing the ideas - wherever that might take you. I've had previous internship stints at Twitter and LinkedIn. <br /><br/> I believe the next wave of entrepreneurship change is in the double bottom line and am excited to be building a direct-giving crowdfunding platform in Asia. We hope to empower people that fall through the cracks. <br /><br/> I'm also extremely passionate about not just starting up, but helping out and am open to opportunities.</p>

  		<p class="home-cont">I'm from Singapore. Singapore is not in China. It's also a country on it's own and is extremely cosmopolitan. This means that we've got the luxury of having a wide range of tasty food. If you're guessing that I love food, you're right. I do. A lot. I also get caught in the rat race every once in a awhile - Singapore is an extremely fast paced country. <br /><br /> While Singapore's known for her quick rise to success, we've also got a group of invisible needy - the group that's left out by policies on paper or in execution. </p>

	<h1 class="more-heading">More About Me</h1>
	<h2 class="subheading1">What are you currently excited about?</h2>
	<p class="subheading1-para">I'm a huge fan of e-sports and am excited to see how virtual reality will eventually lead to the convergence of both e-sports and sports. I really feel that VR is a game-changer and will permeate through all facades of society in the near future.</p>
	<h2 class="subheading2">What's your background?</h2>
	<p class="subheading2-para">I've been involved in a few start ups since year 1 of college. This made me realise that it's extremely important to be able to switch between the consumer, entrepreneur and consultant hats to be successful in business. I eventually joined Conjunct Consulting, a social good consulting organisation, and became a Chapter Director. I've also had a few internship stints in business development - in both analysis and execution of revenue generation.</p>
